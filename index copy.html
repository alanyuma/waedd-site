          <h4>1.4 Overview</h4>
          <p>
            There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about the future of the COVID-19 outbreak and the economic impacts associated with it for the District.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the question at this point is when government and self-imposed social distancing will ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            The April 2020 U.S. forecast from IHS Markit, which underpins the Arizona forecasts, assumes that social distancing begins to relax in the July-August period.
          </p>
          <p>
            The epidemiological uncertainties create economic uncertainties. We are on track for a significant downturn; the question is how bad and for how long.
          </p>
          <p>
            This forecast update is a step in assessing the damage and the recovery. It projects a much more significant adverse shock to the state economy than even thirty days ago in March 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            As more hard data is released in the coming months, we will know more about the economic impacts and the prospects for recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the April U.S. and Arizona forecasts, the baseline projections are assigned a 45% probability; The pessimistic scenario has a 35% probability, and the optimistic scenario has a 20% probability.

          <h4>1.5 Arizona Outlook</h4>
          <p>The national forecast, summarized below, is combined with assumptions about the impact of industry shutdowns on employment and retail sales. Assuming massive reductions in employment in leisure and hospitality and retail trade and significant closures in personal services and health care, during the second quarter of 2020, driven by the government and voluntary social distancing measures.</p>
          <p>To offer the CEDS reader a sense of the estimated shutdown impact, employment in leisure and hospitality is assumed to drop from 335,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 91,000 in the second quarter of 2020.
          Trade, transportation, and utility jobs drop from 546,000 in the last quarter of 2019 to 405,000 in the second quarter. Health care and social services jobs decline by 16,000 jobs as dentists, doctors,
          and physical therapists avoid non-emergency interactions with patients and clients. Personal services fall by 11,000 to reflect the shutdown by barbers, hair, and nail salons.</p>
          <p>Taxable sales at retail establishments and restaurants and bars also experience a massive decline in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The current baseline projections put the magnitude of the coming downturn at about 50% higher than the 2008-2009 recession but shorter in duration. Under current assumptions, it is a quick, sharp shock.
          Total nonfarm employment in Arizona declines by 481,000 from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2020. That translates into a peak-to-trough decline of 16.2%. For comparison, Arizona lost
          305,000 jobs from peak-to-trough (quarterly) during the <em>Great Recession</em>. That was an 11.45 drop.</p>
          <p>On an annual average basis, the forecast calls for state jobs to drop by 10.2% this year from 2019. That falls below the peak-to-trough decline because the downturn begins and ends in 2020.</p>
          <p>The state unemployment rate surges to 19.0% by the fourth quarter of 2020 but then drops rapidly.</p>
          <p>Taxable retail sales decline this year, as job, income and wealth declines take a toll on consumers. Sales at restaurants and bars get hit harder, given the additional headwind from social distancing.</p>
          <p>Population growth slows, with reduced net migration, and that generates lower levels of housing permit activity.</p>
          <p>Once the economic shock settles this year, the recovery should be solid. Arizona was in excellent shape before the outbreak, and once the outbreak is under control, growth will accelerate significantly.</p>
          <p>Growth rates will look very good initially because we are restarting large sectors of the economy, The forecast calls for the level of employment to return to its fourth-quarter 2019 level by the end of 2022.</p>
          <p>The pessimistic scenario assumes a deeper, more prolonged downturn. Arizona jobs decline by 695,000 from the last quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020. That translates into a 23.4% drop.</p>
          <p>The state unemployment rate peaks at 22.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, then gradually declines.</p>
          <p>Under the pessimistic scenario, it takes longer for the state to return to pre-outbreak levels. Jobs return to their late 2019 level in the first quarter of 2025, five years from now.</p>

          <h4>1.6 National Outlook</h4>
          <p>IHS Markit now assumes that the rate of new coronavirus cases will be dwindling by this August, which implies that we will see the gradual lifting of government and voluntary quarantines begin around that time.</p>
          <p>The forecast calls for a very severe economic downturn. It begins with a substantial 3.5% annualized real GDP decline in the first quarter of 2020, followed by a giant 26.5% drop in the second
          quarter. The recession concludes in the third quarter with a drop of 0.4.</p>
          <p>The unemployment rate rises to a peak of 10.3% by the end of 2020. The shape of the recovery is expected to look like the Nike-swoosh: a large drop followed by a gradual improvement. Keep in mind that this refers to the level of economic activity. Rapid growth rates return quickly, but real GDP does not return to its previous peak until the third quarter of 2021.</p>
          <p>The monetary policy response is assumed to be very accommodative, with the federal funds rate near zero for the foreseeable future</p>
          <p>The federal fiscal policy response in the forecast includes the <strong>CARES Act</strong>. It cushions the blow modestly.</p>
          <p>IHS Markit has downgraded performance during the first three quarters of 2020. The peak-to-trough decline has been increased from 3.8% to 8.3%. For perspective, the peak-to-trough decline during the six quarter-long <em>Great Recession</em> was 4.0%.</p>
          <p>The April forecast calls for a 5.4% decline in real GDP on average in 2020, followed by a 6.3 increase in 2021. Thus, the significant reduction this year is followed by a strong rebound from shallow levels of activity. Keep in mind that the annual average decline is much less than the peak-to-trough drop because the downturn begins and ends in 2020.</p>
          <p>Real personal consumption expenditures drop by 5.5. this year and then recover with 7.2% growth in 2021. The drop in household spending is driven by social distancing, the massive wealth decline as
          stock prices drop, and now job and income losses caused by government-imposed business closures. Consumer confidence suffers a major setback.</p>
          <p>Some spending categories are hit harder than others, with travel and tourism related sectors suffering the biggest hits. These sectors include transportation, entertainment, gambling, lodging, food away
          from home, and travel. Real consumer spending on accommodation and food services fall by between 61.0% and 62.0% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of this year. Recreation spending falls by 40.4%. Public transportation expenditures drop by 12.8%.</p>
          <p>Other significant components of consumer spending are affected, as well. In particular, unit sales of light vehicles are projected to decline by 40.2% from the last quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of
          2020.</p>

          <h4>1&period;7 District Quick Facts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Arizona's estimated population in 2019 was 7,278,717. (US Census Bureau, July 1, 2019)</li>
            <li>Total employment in the state of Arizona in 2020 averaged 3.6 million. The largest sectors are trade, transportation, and utilities, education & hospitality, and professional & business services (Bureau of Labor Statistics Economy at a Glance, 2020)</li>
            <li>Between July 2018 and July 2019, Arizona's population grew by 120,693 people, akin to adding a new city the combined size of Yuma and Nogales, according to national and state population estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Dec. 30, 2019 (Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity)</li>
            <li>An analysis of the latest Census numbers shows Arizona is virtually certain to gain a congressional seat after the 2020 census. That's because the population here - up about 871,000 since 2010 - has grown faster in the past decade than the national average. The actual figure to date is a 13.6 percent increase, the seventh fastest rate in the country. (Election Data Services)</li>
            <li>The annual mean wage paid in Arizona for 2019 was $50,930. (Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics)</li>
            <li>Rural areas in Arizona, including Flagstaff, Kingman, Lake Havasu City, Prescott, Sierra Vista, Douglas, and Yuma account for almost 19% of Arizona's population and 12% of all economic activity. (Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity; Bureau of Economic Analysis)</li>
            <li>The Yuma MSA had an estimated population of 229,957 and an employment of 98,792 in 2019. (OEO)</li>
            <li>Yuma is home to one of the largest military installations in the world, the Yuma Proving Ground. (U.S. Army)</li>
            <li>Yuma was ranked among the top 100 Best-Performing Small Cities in the U.S. for job growth between 2013-2020. (Milken Institute&comma; 2020)</li>
            <li>Phoenix, Tucson, and Yuma have more sunny days, on average than any other U.S. city. Approximately 85-90% of the year is sunny weathe(Current Results, 2017)</li>
            <li>The Agua Caliente Solar Project, located 65-miles east of the city of Yuma, Arizona, is a 290MW AC PV solar plant. This photovoltaic project can generate 290 megawatts of electricity, enough to power more
            than 100,000 homes. (Solar Energy Industries Association, 2020)</li>
            <li>In addition to the many services provided to on-campus students, Arizona Western College supports the La Paz and Yuma communities by offering economic development and workforce training programs, small business
            development programs, community learning centers, and scholarship foundations.</li>
            <li>The "</em>reshoring</em>" to North America trend presents tremendous opportunities for Arizona companies that want to open a facility to provide services or raw materials along the District's major Interstate corridors (Interstate 8, 10, 11, & 15)</li>
            <li>The Department of Defenses' primary concentrations of military employment in Arizona are at four major defense installations: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Fort Huachuca, Luke Air Force Base, Yuma Proving Ground, and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma.</li>
