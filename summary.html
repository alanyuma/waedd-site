    <p>&#x21E8; The communities of the Western Arizona Economic Development District (the <i>‘District’</i>) possess considerable development potential, both in expanding their existing economic base sectors and in diversifying their economies.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; There are also severe constraints to development that affect every community.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; The communities of the Western Arizona Economic Development District (the <i>‘District’</i>) possess considerable development potential, both in expanding their existing economic base sectors and in diversifying their economies.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; Limitations are almost invariably externally imposed. Existing federal and state policies and practices regarding establishing highway service levels, siting of higher education facilities, making land available for local community development, etc., all severely disadvantage District communities.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; The District’s communities will continue to see rapid growth over the coming decade and beyond. Economic diversification and development are needed to assure that the impact of growth is positive, our communities stay livable, and our residents and businesses enjoy prosperity.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; Unlike some cities in other areas, District communities do not need to, and may not desire to promote growth. Economic development measures must control and direct that growth into definite channels.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; The success of these strategies will depend on many factors. These will include local government willingness to proactively address growth and development issues, a continuation of regional and local planning efforts, and good relations and cooperation between local governments, businesses, educational institutions, and labor.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; Unfortunately, critical components of development strategies lie outside of local control. State policies regarding higher educational institutions, funding for schools, workforce training programs, making state lands available for development, and providing adequate highway access to District communities may cripple even the most dedicated development programs.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; Ultimately, regional development and the livability of our communities may depend on our ability to change state and federal policies that adversely impact our communities and their development.</p>
    <p>&#x21E8; It is <em><strong>essential</strong></em> for rural communities to plan their economic growth in a way that complements and leverages their existing assets.</p>
