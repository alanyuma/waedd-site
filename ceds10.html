          <h1 class="heading1">10.0 Economic Resilence</h1>
            <p>
                The SWOT analysis conducted by the District CEDS committee identified a variety of vulnerabilities that have caused or could potentially cause major economic problems, both locally and regionally.  According to the EDA, “in the context of economic development, economic resilience becomes inclusive of three major attributes: the ability to recover quickly from shock, the ability to withstand a shock, and the ability to avoid the shock altogether.” EDA further states that these shocks or disruptions can often be categorized in the following ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Downturns or other significant events in the national or International economy which impact demand or for locally produced goods and consumer spending;
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Declines in a particular industry that constitute a critical component of the activity, and/or;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other external shocks (a natural or man-made disaster, closure of a military base, exit of a major employer, the impacts of climate change, etc.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Other external shocks (a natural or man-made disaster, closure of a military base, exit of a major employer, the impacts of climate change, etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Economic resiliency is not only discussed in this section of the CEDS, but it is actually woven throughout the entire document. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss resiliency efforts already underway and discuss how resilience is a multi-faceted issue with many different components. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the overall purpose of economic resilience is to save and create as many jobs as possible, so that when a shock occurs, which is inevitable, the community, region, and people have options.

          <h4 class="heading4">10.1 Economic vs. Physical Shocks</h4>
        <p>
            When examining the types of shocks that a community needs to plan for, most can be categorized in one of two ways, economic shocks, and physical shocks. Economic shocks are those which are caused primarily by economic forces such as the closing of a major factory that results in a significant loss in employment, a national recession, or change in regulations that affect importing and exporting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical shocks are those who, cause harm to either built or natural environment or both, such as a hurricane, or an oil spill. Obviously, physical shocks are economic in nature as well. So, the issue is not just repairing physical damage, but restoring the economic damage and loss of income and businesses. Whether the shock comes as a financial shock or physical shock, it's essential that all aspects of the community be resilient: people, the built environment, and industries.

        <h6 class="heading6">10.2.1 Hazard Mitigation</h6>
            <p>
                Economic resilience is essential for both economic shocks and physical shocks, but hazard mitigation is a tool that is mainly focused on physical shocks. Hazard mitigation planning is often focused primarily on natural disasters in which we usually have some advance warning. But hazard mitigation should also focus on physical shocks that come along with no indication. Each County in the district has adopted a hazard mitigation plan which outlines how to prepare for and react to hazards and the resources available in the event of a disaster.

                In the region, extremely hot weather preparedness and massive dust storms during Arizona’s summer months and “monsoon season.” The monsoon season begins on June 15 and ends on September 30, but the peak of the storm between mid-July and mid-August. On average, about half of Arizona receives nearly half of its annual rainfall during the monsoon.

        <h6 class="heading6">10.3.1 Creating Resilient People</h6>
            <p>
                <strong>Education</strong> To have a resilient workforce, training and education should support local industry and should be adaptable and flexible enough to change as new industries emerge, or as existing industries grow and evolve over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Communication</strong> The region should strive for excellent communication, whether it involves a discussion about jobs and training opportunities, or advance warning for storms and disaster preparedness.
            </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Quality of life.</strong> Healthy and happy people tend to be more able and resilient in times of hardship, and excellent quality of life can make an area marketable and appealing to a new industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Safety.</strong> Providing a safe environment, either daily through good building and infrastructure, or during a time of real crisis, such as the availability of shelters and evacuation routes during a storm.
            </p>
        <h6 class="heading6">10.3.2 Creating Resilient Environment</h6>
            <p>
                <strong>Structures.</strong> Implementing building construction codes that result in sturdy construction create a built environment that is less vulnerable to natural disasters and will sustain the test of time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Infrastructure.</strong> A new and up-to-date infrastructure that is stronger and more resilient that can withstand a natural disaster is a marketable feature for recruiting new industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Land suitability.</strong> Building on land suitable for development Reduces vulnerability to natural disasters. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Site Redevelopment.</strong> Redevelopment of an existing or underutilized site is often more efficient and cost-effective than developing a new size. 
            </p>
        <h6 class="heading6">10.3.3 Creating Resilient Industry</h6>
            <p>
                <strong>Diversity.</strong> Industry in the region. The old saying, “don't put all of your eggs in one basket,” apply. For example, a chemical plant closing does not impact the tourism industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Adaptability.</strong> As technologies change an economy's wax and wane, the industry needs to be adaptable to the current market, and the workforce should be adapted to meet those changing needs. Industry and adaptability and often occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Innovation.</strong> Industry innovation often goes hand-in-hand with diversity and adaptability and usually occurs as a response to a physical or economic shock.
