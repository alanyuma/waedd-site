          <h4 class="heading4">5.1 Mohave County</h4>
          <p>
            The Mohave County workforce is divided by the different cities and Mohave County with each having different workforce skill sets as well as different unemployment and growth percentages.
        </p>
          <h4 class="heading4">5.1.1 Kingman Economic Region</h4>
        <p>
            The Kingman Economic Region is made up of eight zip codes that encompass 2,133 square miles, which contained about 63,000 people in 2018. This region has the highest population density of the three geographies detailed in this report at 28.9 persons per square mile, who compose a total of 24,063 households, with a household size of 2.6. 
        </p>    
        <p>

            This economic region contains the most diverse of the three, and hosts significant concentrations of manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and aviation industries, in addition to, healthcare and tourism industries. The Kingman Economic Region must take advantage of its existing critical mass of sectors, as well as, continue to develop its multimodal transportation options. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As ports on the west coast continue to experience more unloading delays, the freight hauling, and logistics industries will be looking for alternatives further and further inland, since unloading delays cause massive monetary losses for these industries. Attracting sectors that focus on alternative energy component manufacturing (as opposed to generation) such as solar cells, is also worthy of some attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kingman Economic Region contains a high percentage of Arts and Entertainment, Healthcare Services, and Manufacturing, making up 28.2 percent, 13.8 percent, and 5.9 percent of the region’s total employment, respectively. The average cluster wages of Healthcare Services and Manufacturing, at $50,850 and $55,238, are well more than the region’s total average salary of $40,027. The Arts and Entertainment Cluster, on average, pays about $11,000 less than the overall regional average wage.

         <h4 class="heading4">5.1.4 Greater Yuma County (including La Paz County) Economic Region
        </h4>
        <p>
            High unemployment remains an issue in Yuma. Citing August 2019 data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked Yuma as #1 among the 13 U.S. cities that post unemployment rates above 15 percent. Yuma's agricultural workforce, which adjusts to the picking season, is cited as the reason for the high unemployment by the Arizona Department of Commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma County has always been seen as a lower wage area. Yuma County also chronically has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country approaching a high of 30 percent at one time (August 2010). But many of the unemployed lack the training, skills, and certification to fill the better-paying jobs that are available. Companies with the need for more skilled labor come to job fairs, only to leave empty-handed because they can't find qualified applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only do available jobs go wanting for lack of qualified applicants, but it also means the area has trouble attracting companies that offer better-paying jobs. Yuma County continues to be the destination for the lower-paying jobs. The area must have to have a higher-skilled workforce to attract better-paying jobs. On the other hand, the lack of higher-skilled jobs drives young people to leave the community to seek careers elsewhere. And others who come to Yuma as the spouses of military and professionals often are unable to find a job here to match their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            The community has made some strides, such as the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and math) program now being offered by Yuma Union High School District in partnership with Arizona Western College. The college in collaboration with the University of Arizona also is making it easier for Yumans to pursue college degrees in such fields as engineering. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The top ten employers in Yuma County based on number of employees are: #1 US Army Proving Ground (YPG) (military); #2 Yuma Regional Medical Center (healthcare); #3 Yuma Elementary School District (education) #4 Wal-Mart Stores (retail); #5 City of Yuma (government); #6 Yuma County (government); #7 US Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) (military); #8 Bose Corporation (manufacturing); #9 US Border Patrol (government); and #10 ACT, Advanced Call Center Technologies (call center).
        </p>
        <p>
            The unemployment rate in Yuma County is 12.0% (February 2020), with job growth of - 0.42%. Future job growth over the next ten years is predicted to be 15.46%. For the same month, the metro unemployment rate was 7.5 percentage points higher than the Arizona rate.
