      <h4>1&period;4 Overview</h4>
      <p>There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about the future of the COVID&#45;19 outbreak and the economic impacts associated with it for the District&period;</p>
      <p>Regarding the COVID&#45;19 pandemic&comma; the question at this point is when government and self&comma;imposed social distancing will ease&period;</p>
      <p>The April 2020 U&period;S&period; forecast from IHS Markit&comma; which underpins the Arizona forecasts&comma; assumes that social distancing begins to relax in the July&#45;August period&period;</p>
      <p>The epidemiological uncertainties create economic uncertainties&period; We are on track for a significant downturn&semi; the question is how bad and for how long&period;</p>
      <p>This forecast update is a step in assessing the damage and the recovery&period; It projects a much more significant adverse shock to the state economy than even thirty days ago in March 2020&period;</p>
      <p>As more hard data is released in the coming months&comma; we will know more about the economic impacts and the prospects for recovery&period;</p>
      <p>For the April U&period;S&period; and Arizona forecasts&comma; the baseline projections are assigned a 45&percnt; probability&period; The pessimistic scenario has a 35&percnt; probability&comma; and the optimistic scenario has a 20&percnt;
      probability&period;</p>

      <h4>1&period;5 Arizona Outlook</h4>
      <p>The national forecast&comma; summarized below&comma; is combined with assumptions about the impact of industry shutdowns on employment and retail sales&period; Assuming massive reductions in employment in leisure and hospitality and retail
      trade and significant closures in personal services and health care&comma; during the second quarter of 2020&comma; driven by the government and voluntary social distancing measures&period;</p>
      <p>To offer the CEDS reader a sense of the estimated shutdown impact&comma; employment in leisure and hospitality is assumed to drop from 335&comma;000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 91&comma;000 in the second quarter of 2020&period;
      Trade&comma; transportation&comma; and utility jobs drop from 546&comma;000 in the last quarter of 2019 to 405&comma;000 in the second quarter. Health care and social services jobs decline by 16&comma;000 jobs as dentists&comma; doctors&comma;
      and physical therapists avoid non&#45;emergency interactions with patients and clients. Personal services fall by 11&comma;000 to reflect the shutdown by barbers&comma; hair&comma; and nail salons&period;</p>
      <p>Taxable sales at retail establishments and restaurants and bars also experience a massive decline in the second quarter&period;</p>
      <p>The current baseline projections put the magnitude of the coming downturn at about 50&percnt; higher than the 2008&#45;2009 recession but shorter in duration&period; Under current assumptions&comma; it is a quick&comma; sharp shock&period;
      Total nonfarm employment in Arizona declines by 481&comma;000 from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2020&period; That translates into a peak&#45;to&#45;trough decline of 16.2&percnt;&period; For comparison&comma; Arizona lost
      305&comma;000 jobs from peak&#45;to&#45;trough &lpar;quarterly&rpar; during the <em>Great Recession</em>&period; That was an 11&period;4&percnt; drop&period;</p>
      <p>On an annual average basis&comma; the forecast calls for state jobs to drop by 10&period;2&percnt; this year from 2019&period; That falls below the peak&#45;to&#45;trough decline because the downturn begins and ends in 2020&period;</p>
      <p>The state unemployment rate surges to 19&period;0&percnt; by the fourth quarter of 2020 but then drops rapidly&period;</p>
      <p>Taxable retail sales decline this year&comma; as job&comma; income and wealth declines take a toll on consumers&period; Sales at restaurants and bars get hit harder&comma; given the additional headwind from social distancing&period;</p>
      <p>Population growth slows&comma; with reduced net migration&comma; and that generates lower levels of housing permit activity&period;</p>
      <p>Once the economic shock settles this year&comma; the recovery should be solid&period; Arizona was in excellent shape before the outbreak&comma; and once the outbreak is under control&comma; growth will accelerate significantly&period;</p>
      <p>Growth rates will look very good initially because we&apos;re restarting large sectors of the economy&period; The forecast calls for the level of employment to return to its fourth&#45;quarter 2019 level by the end of 2022&period;</p>
      <p>The pessimistic scenario assumes a deeper&comma; more prolonged downturn&period; Arizona jobs decline by 695&comma;000 from the last quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020&period; That translates into a 23&period;4&percnt;
      drop&period;</p>
      <p>The state unemployment rate peaks at 22.3&percnt; in the fourth quarter of 2020&comma; then gradually declines&period;</p>
      <p>Under the pessimistic scenario&comma; it takes longer for the state to return to pre&#45;outbreak levels&period; Jobs return to their late 2019 level in the first quarter of 2025&comma; five years from now&period;</p>

      <h4>1&period;6 National Outlook</h4>
      <p>IHS Markit now assumes that the rate of new coronavirus cases will be dwindling by this August&comma; which implies that we will see the gradual lifting of government and voluntary quarantines begin around that time&period;</p>
      <p>The forecast calls for a very severe economic downturn&period; It begins with a substantial 3&period;5&percnt; annualized real GDP decline in the first quarter of 2020&comma; followed by a giant 26.5&percnt; drop in the second
      quarter&period; The recession concludes in the third quarter with a drop of 0&period;4&percnt;&period;</p>
      <p>The unemployment rate rises to a peak of 10&period;3&percnt; by the end of 2020&period; The shape of the recovery is expected to look like the Nike-swoosh: a large drop followed by a gradual improvement. Keep in mind that this refers to the
      level of economic activity&period; Rapid growth rates return quickly&comma; but real GDP does not return to its previous peak until the third quarter of 2021&period;</p>
      <p>The monetary policy response is assumed to be very accommodative&comma; with the federal funds rate near zero for the foreseeable future&period;</p>
      <p>The federal fiscal policy response in the forecast includes the CARES Act&period; It cushions the blow modestly&period;</p>
      <p>IHS Markit has downgraded performance during the first three quarters of 2020&period; The peak&#45;to&#45;trough decline has been increased from 3&period;8&percnt; to 8&period;3&percnt;&period; For perspective&comma; the
      peak&#45;to&#45;trough decline during the six quarter&#45;long <em>Great Recession</em> was 4&period;0&percnt;&period;</p>
      <p>The April forecast calls for a 5&period;4&percnt; decline in real GDP on average in 2020&comma; followed by a 6&period;3&percnt; increase in 2021&period; Thus&comma; the significant reduction this year is followed by a strong rebound from
      shallow levels of activity&period; Keep in mind that the annual average decline is much less than the peak&#45;to&#45;trough drop because the downturn begins and ends in 2020&period;</p>
      <p>Real personal consumption expenditures drop by 5&period;5&percnt; this year and then recover with 7&period;2&percnt; growth in 2021&period; The drop in household spending is driven by social distancing&comma; the massive wealth decline as
      stock prices drop&comma; and now job and income losses caused by government&#45;imposed business closures&period; Consumer confidence suffers a major setback&period;</p>
      <p>Some spending categories are hit harder than others&comma; with travel and tourism related sectors suffering the biggest hits&period; These sectors include transportation&comma; entertainment&comma; gambling&comma; lodging&comma; food away
      from home&comma; and travel&period; Real consumer spending on accommodation and food services fall by between 61&period;0&percnt; and 62&period;0&percnt; from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of this year&period; Recreation
      spending falls by 40&period;4&percnt;&period; Public transportation expenditures drop by 12&period;8&percnt;&period;</p>
      <p>Other significant components of consumer spending are affected&comma; as well&period; In particular&comma; unit sales of light vehicles are projected to decline by 40&period;2&percnt; from the last quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of
      2020&period;</p>
