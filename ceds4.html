          <h1 class="heading1">4.0 Economic Clusters</h1>
          <h4 class="heading4">4.1 Agricultural</h4>
          <h5 class="heading5">4.1.1 Yuma County</h5>
            <p>
                A $3.2 billion annual agribusiness industry forms the foundation of Yuma County or more than one-third of Arizona's annual total of $9.2 billion. Yuma’s agribusiness sector is responsible for supplying the United States with 80 percent of its winter, leafy vegetables. A variety of industrial, processing, and logistics operations take advantage of Yuma's strategic location, increasing Yuma's economic diversity.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Undisputedly, agriculture is the number one industry for Yuma County.  According to a 2013 University of Arizona study, agriculture produces an estimated $2.5 billion a year into the Yuma economy. This is due to our fertile soil (sediments deposited by the Colorado River over millions of years), progressive farmers (who explore and utilize the latest theories and technology in their fields), sufficient labor (highly skilled and motivated workforce), and senior rights to irrigation water. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lettuce is the largest winter crop in Yuma, it is by no means the only one. There are over 175 different crops grown in the Yuma area year-round! The list includes alfalfa, Bermuda grass seed, cotton, dates, lemons, melons, and wheat. Desert Durum accounts for 95% of the wheat grown in Yuma County, and about two-thirds of that is exported to Italy for use in making premium pasta.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mexican free port of San Luis Rio Colorado is located 23 miles southwest, luring industries interested in offshore manufacturing, or The Mexican free port of San Luis Rio Colorado is located 23 miles southwest, luring industries interested in offshore manufacturing, or twin-plant operations (also known known as 'maquiladoras').
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, if Yuma County were a country, its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) would rank 151 out of 192 countries. Yes, that's countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                GDP is defined as the monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a region's borders.  Yuma's GDP for 2018 was calculated at nearly $8.3 billion. The government contributed $1.5 billion and private industries $3.8 billion. The three most significant sectors in the Yuma economy are agriculture, military, and tourism. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Dates are a remarkable fruit and are another essential piece of the Yuma Ag industry, just like all the other vegetables grown here. As long as people need to eat, farmers will continue to keep Agriculture the leading sector in Yuma.

          <h4 class="heading4">4.2 Aviation</h4>
          <h5 class="heading5">4.2.1 Yuma County</h5>
        <p>
            More than $45 million in both public and private funding have been invested in Yuma International Airport over the past ten years. Some of that $45 million has funded improvements to runways, taxiways, and parking aprons, the terminal and other infrastructure to benefit the flying public.
        </p>  
        <p>
            However, much of the focus has been on developing the west side of the airport into the Defense Contractor Complex to provide facilities for both short- and long-term leasing by defense contractors working to support the missions of Yuma's two military installations: Yuma Proving Ground and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (with critical national defense missions), as well as aviation giants including Boeing, GE Aviation, Gulfstream, Honda Jet, NASA, Pratt & Whitney and US Customs and Border Protection.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The continuation of economic expansion in Yuma County continues to drive economic development strategies for market development aimed at four diversified industries with the highest growth potential. Aviation is one such commercial industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Yuma International Airport and Yuma County Airport Authority work closely with the decision-makers in the aerospace industry, other government agencies, and academic institutions to coordinate business development. In addition to commercial, general, and military flight operations, Yuma International Airport also has a definite talent for air transport, limited aircraft maintenance, airport service, and flight training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Public program funds help local governments and airport authorities to plan, design, build, and maintain public aviation facilities. An example of an economic development project is an industrial park's facilities at a general airport. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Commercial and general aviation plays a crucial role in stimulating economic growth, employment, and investment in the United States. There are more than 5,000 US public airports, and fewer than 500 have a commercial airline server, which makes commercial and general aviation very important.

        <h4 class="heading4">4.3 Defense</h4>
        <h5 class="heading5">4.3.1 Marine Corps Air Station Yuma</h5>
        <p>
            Yuma is home to two of the largest military installations in the United States. Marine Corps Air Station-Yuma is the country’s foremost Marine Air Base with an estimated population of more than 7,500 pilots, aviation technicians, and aeronautical mechanics. The Marine Corps Air Station Yuma’s economic impact in the local region in 2018 is $692 million. The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground generates an annual economic impact of over $430 million. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The United States Military has been in Yuma for over 150 years.  Today, it is the second largest industry in Yuma County as we are home to the Yuma Proving Ground and the Marine Corps Air Station – Yuma. With the arrival of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the military’s future in Yuma is bright.
        </p>
        <p>
            The U.S. Army first came to the area in 1851 and established Fort Yuma on Indian Hill. The installation overlooked the Yuma Crossing, the aptly named low spot in the Colorado River, and it allowed for the establishment of the townsite of what would later become Yuma.  In 1864 the US Army put up the Quartermaster Depot along the river. From here the US Army oversaw the distribution of supplies to soldiers in the West.
        </p>
        <p>
            MCAS Yuma has the F-35, and Yuma Proving Ground has the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School. The purpose of the military free-fall facility will allow special forces, troops, to train for air operations requiring free falls from airplanes. The facility opened in January of 2014 and, at 75 feet tall, is the largest in the world. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Yuma’s military roots are extensive, and those traditions will not be slowing any time soon. With more than 5,000 Marines and sailors stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and thousands more that travel there for training, the airbase serves as an integral part of the Yuma economy. Along with the number of Marines and sailors stationed at MCAS-Yuma, estimates that there are over 7,000 family members with them, approximately 1,300 civilian employees on base and most days, an additional 1,000 military members using the facility for training purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The air station annually hosts approximately 70 aviation units, bringing an average of 600 aircraft and 14,000 personnel for ongoing training that takes place throughout the year. With access to 2.8 million acres of bombing and aviation training ranges and superb flying weather, MCAS Yuma supports 80 percent of the Corps' air-to-ground aviation training. Each year, the air station hosts numerous units and aircraft from U.S. and NATO forces.

        <h5 class="heading5">4.3.2 Yuma Proving Ground</h5>
        <p>
            Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) is the busiest United States Army testing center in the nation and a huge economic boon for surrounding communities in the District.
        </p>
        <p> 
            <picture>
                <!--<source srcset="img/png/ceds-4-3-2-ypg.png "style="width: 250px; height: 250px; border: 1px solid blue; float: left; margin-right: 15px;margin-top: 15px;" alt="cannon at yuma proving ground entrance">-->
                <img src="img/webp/ceds-4-3-2-ypg.webp" style="width: 250px; height: 250px; border: 1px solid blue; float: left; margin-right: 15px;margin-top: 15px;" alt="cannon at yuma proving ground entrance">
            </picture>

            YPG takes up about 20 percent of Yuma County and stretches north into La Paz County. YPG spans about 840,000 acres, the test center is about one-third the size of Massachusetts. About 1,700 employees, mostly civilians, test a wide variety of military hardware including unmanned aircraft, helicopter weapons, artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, machine guns, mortars, and parachutes. 
        </picture> 
        <p> 
            In a typical year at YPG, test personnel fire tens of thousands of artillery, mortar and missile rounds, 36,000 parachute drops take place, over 130,000 miles driven on test vehicles, and nearly 4,000 air sorties flown. YPG is the largest high technology employer in the county and pumps a large amount of cash into the local economy. YPG spends about $160 million in payroll dollars into the Greater Yuma economy each year. The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground generates an annual economic impact of over $430 million.
        </p>

        <h4 class="heading4">4.4 Tourism</h4>
        <p>
            The District’s economy has an unusual degree of stability, as the tourism base that many communities depend upon is relatively resistant to economic downturns. District tourism is either relatively low cost, access by motor vehicle recreational tourism from Southern California, and maintains through economic recession periods. Recessions only mildly impact winter visitors, snowbirds, RV tourism, and fixed income visitors. During the winter months, more than 100,000 winter visitors flock to the Yuma County communities to enjoy sun-drenched warmth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arizona State Parks have a significant economic impact on communities and counties. A state park’s value is, of course, not measured by financial impact alone. Parks enhance community quality-of-life and preserve invaluable historical, cultural, and recreational resources for residents and visitors from around the world. However, communities are increasingly recognizing that State Parks improve the economic well-being of rural counties and serve as an essential tourism resource.
        </p>
        <h5 class="heading5">4.4.1 Yuma County</h5>
        <p>
            Tourism is one of Yuma County's most prominent economic drivers, and Mexican visitors are an essential contributor. Travel and tourism continue to be among the most important export industries driving Arizona’s economy, and Mexican visitors are a primary contributor to this sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tourism is the third biggest industry in Yuma County. According to documents obtained by the Yuma Visitors Bureau, 2018 saw $785.0 million in Direct Travel Spending. That income created 6,500 jobs, generated $226 million in earnings, and $67.0 million in additional taxes.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma has plenty to offer travelers and tourists alike.  However, there is no doubt that Yuma's winters are some of the best in the country and draw the majority of visitors between November and April every year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just how many winter visitors come tends to be an elusive number.  At the peak of our winter visitor season, February, it is estimated we have about 80,000 visitors. February is the peak of the season as many places on the continent are experiencing some of their coldest temperatures.  
        </p>
        <p>
            However, no matter the numbers, they have a significant impact on the area. Consider that the City of Yuma's year-round population is about 98,000 (2018). Adding another 80,000 is a significant seasonal influx of people to the community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's winter visitors are not quite the same breed as they were 25 years ago. Our nation’s youngest retirees come to Yuma and are highly active! They hit the casinos, browse the swap meets, attend arts and crafts shows, local patron events and fill seats at concerts. They enjoy hiking in the desert, playing golf, and fishing. They visit Mexico for medical and dental treatment and stay to linger over lunch and margaritas.
        </p>
        <h5 class="heading5">4.4.2 Mexican Spending</h5>
        <p>
            Mexican visitors spend an estimated $2.2 billion on food, clothing, entertainment, and other activities in Yuma County each year, according to a speaker at an economic forum in 2012. That represents more than 6 percent of all taxable sales. That spending directly supports more than 2,000 local jobs.

        <h5 class="heading5">4.5 Other Economic Clusters</h5>
        <h6 class="heading6">4.5.1 Food Processing</h6>
        <p>
          Food processing is seen as a logical extension of Yuma’s agricultural industry. Food processing plants can locate within close proximity to agricultural production. 
      </p>
      <h6 class="heading6">4.5.2 Military & Defense Testing</h6>
      <p>
          With the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, the Yuma Proving Ground, and the Barry M. Goldwater Range, there is a significant military presence in the region. Weapons are tested at the Yuma Proving Ground. This would make the area a natural location for companies that supply the military and whose arms would need testing.
      </p>
      <h6 class="heading6">4.5.3 Industrial Manufacturing</h6>
      <p>
          Proximity to Mexican and California markets is seen as an advantage for the Yuma region in industrial manufacturing. Low unionization and relatively low wages are also seen as an advantage. 
      </p>
      <h6 class="heading6">4.5.4 Logistics & Distribution</h6>
      <p>
          Proximity to Mexican and California markets is also seen as an advantage for the Yuma region in logistics and distribution. Yuma County is also considered to have an advantage because of the high capacity port of entry at San Luis II, the UP-Sunset Corridor, and Interstate 8. Yuma is also less than 250 miles from the Ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach, CA, and 498 miles from the Port of Guaymas in Mexico. 
      </p>
      <h6 class="heading6">4.5.5 Renewable Energy</h6>
      <p>
          Seven companies have committed to building utility-scale renewable energy plants within three hours of Yuma. According to the Solar Foundation, Arizona is ranked third in the nation for solar. Arizona Western College Solar Array Testing Site provides research on solar energy, thus providing a connection between solar technology and the region. With its dry weather, Arizona is a logical location for solar power. Manufacturers of solar equipment would be expected to locate near places of demand for their products, i.e., solar power production. 
      </p>
      <h6 class="heading6">4.5.6 Twin Plant/Maquila Operations</h6>
      <p>
          Proximity to Mexican and California markets is seen as an advantage for the Yuma region in twin plant/maquila operations. San Luis Rio Colorado is the third-largest municipality within the State of Sonora.

        <h5 class="heading5">4.6.1 Air Access</h5>    
        <p>
            Yuma, Bullhead City, Kingman, and Lake Havasu City have commercial rated airports.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma International Airport, a shared-use airport together with Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, is located three nautical miles south of the central business district of Yuma. Yuma International Airport is managed and operated by the Yuma County Airport Authority, Inc. (YCAA).   
        </p>
        <p>
            Under Arizona law, an Airport Authority is an independent public agency and incorporated as a non-profit organization in the State of Arizona on December 30, 1965. The YCAA management team is composed of experienced aviation professionals and has a long history of providing support to the aviation and aerospace industry.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma International Airport offers reasonably frequent service (American Airlines) to important hubs (Phoenix and Dallas/Fort Worth). Connections to other destinations are relatively convenient, and airfares are not unreasonable. Federal Express is located on the airport; however, there are no large air cargo operations in Yuma.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Laughlin-Bullhead City Airport is a public airport located one mile north of the central business district of Bullhead City, in Mohave County. The airport is across the Colorado River and one block away from the community of Laughlin, Nevada. Many of the rooms at Laughlin's casino-hotels offer a view of the chartered and private flights that utilize the airport. No larger commercial airlines currently serve the airport. It was named 2011 Airport of the Year by the Arizona Department of Transportation. There is currently no scheduled commercial air service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flights to any destination are limited to travel days and frequency. Bullhead City is also served by casino charter flights, which bring tourists to Laughlin from many cities around the country, but such trips do not provide for the general or business traveler. Air cargo facilities are not available. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kingman Airport is a city-owned public airport nine miles northeast of Kingman, in Mohave County. It has scheduled service on one airline, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. Some aircraft are stored or scrapped there. Again, air cargo facilities are not available. No airlines serve the airport as of late 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Lake Havasu City Airport is a city-owned public-use airport located six miles north of the central business district of Lake Havasu City, in Mohave County. The airport is mostly used for general aviation. Until May 5, 2007, scheduled service to Phoenix and Las Vegas was provided by Mesa Airlines, operating as US Airways Express. Again, air cargo facilities do not exist.

        <h5 class="heading5">4.6.2 Highways</h5>
        <p>
            Three Interstates traverse the District. Interstate 40 goes east/west through Mohave County and through Kingman. Interstate 10 transits, east/west through La Paz County, and Quartzsite. Interstate 8 traverses southern Yuma County and the communities of Yuma and Wellton.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Interstate corridors provide excellent east/ west access in and out of the District, linking the District to Tucson, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego. All provide viable commercial transportation corridors for trucking, and together constitute an advantageous situation for the District in serving these industrial markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only north/south transportation corridor within the District is US/AZ Highway 95, which goes from the Mexican border to Bullhead City, traversing San Luis, Somerton, Yuma, Quartzsite, Parker, and Lake Havasu City. The stretch from San Luis through Yuma is adequate, with some recent improvements having been made. This stretch is a viable commercial corridor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Yuma Area Service Highway is a 25-mile-long project extending from the Mexico border near San Luis, Arizona to Interstate 8. This Highway further facilitates commercial traffic and helps establish San Luis and Yuma County as a desirable location for commercial border crossings and industrial development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The route (State Route 195), locally known as the Area Service Highway (ASH) or Robert A. Vaughan Expressway, is designed to expedite the flow of commercial traffic between the United States and Mexico by channeling large tractor-trailers through the new Port of Entry.  
        </p>

            And while construction lags on the Mexico side have delayed the opening of the port, the highway provides a more direct route for motorists traveling between the border and east Yuma and the Foothills. Also, more immediately, the road should ease traffic congestion in Yuma by diverting the commercial tractor-trailers that currently travel on Yuma streets on the way to an Interstate 8 linkup.

            Planning for SR 195 began in the early 1990s. In January 1999, an intergovernmental agreement was approved between ADOT, Yuma County, the cities of Yuma and San Luis, the town of Wellton, and the Cocopah Tribe. In 2000, voters approved $13.15 million in local funding as part of the Yuma County Capital Improvement half-cent sales tax, which has since been retired. The total cost of the 26-mile highway was $92 million. Work began on the SR 195 in late 2007, and sections of the road became open to travel as they were completed.

            The corridor from Yuma north through Bullhead City is a very different picture. This portion of the US/AZ 95 corridor is subject to extreme seasonal variations in use in segments, with heavy tourist use during the winter months. While the condition of the road is adequate for the low traffic load periods of each year, the virtually complete lack of four-lane sections and passing lanes renders the highways unacceptable for commercial usage at any time of the year, but particularly during the tourist season. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As there are no current plans to provide reasonable numbers of either four-lane sections or passing lanes in the foreseeable future, the lack of a viable north/south commercial corridor for the District is unlikely to be remedied.
        </p>
        <p>
            Communities lacking adequate access to the Interstate corridors include Parker, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Colorado City. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The East/West transportation corridors give the District’s communities an opportunity for more diversified industrial development. Interstates 40, 10, and 8 provide quick access by truck to the major urban centers of Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and the ports associated with Los Angeles and San Diego. East/West rail lines through La Paz County, Kingman, and Yuma also provide access to important markets.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, lack of interstate and rail access creates difficulties for development in Bullhead City, Lake Havasu, and other District communities. North/South transportation corridors are not as advantageous.

        <p>
            No rail lines run north/south through the District, all air travel is to/through Phoenix (except for flights from Bullhead City to a variety of destinations serving the Laughlin Casino industry). The main North/South highway US/AZ 95 is not constructed nor maintained at an appropriate service level for the heavy winter seasonal travel loads, creating dangerous and slow travel conditions for much of the year. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides, US/AZ 95 is not an all-weather road, being bisected by 81 washes in the 81-mile stretch from Yuma to Quartzsite, creating flooding and closure problems during the infrequent rains.
