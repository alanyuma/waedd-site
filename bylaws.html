    <h1 class="heading1">BYLAWS</h1>
    <p><strong>OF THE WESTERN ARIZONA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT</strong></p>
    <h6>Adopted September 9, 2004 </h6>
    <h6>Revised August 10, 2020 </h6>

<h4 class="heading4">Statement of Principles and Policies:</h4>
    <p>
        The underlying concept of the Economic Development District (the <strong>DISTRICT</strong>) is that cities, towns, and counties, which are most familiar with their particular socio-economic conditions, should exercise the primary responsibility for treating those problems or needs through a countywide or regional planned strategy.
</p>
    <p>
        The area of concern for the Economic Development District is defined as the area lying within the geographic boundaries of La Paz, Mohave, and Yuma Counties (Counties).
</p>
    <p>
        Programs and projects to address socio-economic problems of local government shall be developed in regular meetings of each County per the policies developed by the District Organization Committee.
</p>
    <p>
        The District is based on the principle of equality of membership. Nothing contained in these <strong>BYLAWS</strong> shall authorize the District Organization Committee to intervene in matters which are mostly within the jurisdiction of any one (1) member without its consent.
</p>
    <p>
        The <strong>DISTRICT</strong> is not, nor is it intended to be, a substitute for local government. It is, however, an organization through which individual governmental units can work on and resolve regional problems and coordinate their efforts
    </p>
<h4 class="heading4">ARTICLE 1 - FUNCTIONS</h4>
    <p>
        The general functions of the <strong>DISTRICT</strong> are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        1.1 To provide a forum for discussion and evaluation of economic problems and opportunities of mutual interest and concern to the governments within the Counties (La Paz, Mohave, and Yuma).
    </p>
    <p>
        1.2 To ensure, through cooperation and the combined resources, maximum efficiency, and economy in governmental operations, which will provide every citizen with the utmost value for every tax dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.3 To understand, clarify, identify, and comprehensively plan for the solution of regional problems requiring jurisdictional cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.4 To facilitate agreements among the governmental units on specific projects or other interrelated development actions or for the adoption of standard policies concerning issues that are common to its members.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.5 To attain the highest degree of intergovernmental cooperation possible to prepare for future growth and development of the Counties.

    <p>
        3.5 The membership of the Economic Development District can be augmented by a vote of the total current membership.</p> <sub><mark>Paul: Does this mean for one of the specific committees or some general membership reference.
