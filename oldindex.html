        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>We help build sustainable economic success through regional community and economic development partnerships.</p>
        <p>Comprehensive economic development planning for business resilience planning, "main street" business services, and tourism development is a significant focus that includes public works and infrastructure development for sustainable
        economic growth in the region.</p><a id="what-we-do"></a>
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>The three counties of the District, La Paz, Mohave, and Yuma, are primarily rural with diverse communities.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to codify a regional strategy to advance rural prosperity and improve the quality of life.</p><a id="communities"></a>
        <h3>Communities</h3>
        <p>Our area includes three counties in Arizona: La Paz, Mohave, and Yuma; ten cities and towns: City of Yuma, City of Somerton, City of San Luis, Town of Wellton, Town of Parker, Town of Quartzsite, City of Kingman, Bullhead City, Lake
        Havasu City, and Colorado City; and six reservations wholly or partly in the District: Quechan, Cocopah, Colorado River Indian Tribes, Fort Mohave, Hualapai, and Kaibab-Paiute.</p>
        <p>The District stretches from Mexico on the South to Nevada and Utah on the North and is bounded by California and Nevada on the West.</p>
        <p>The District covers 23,519 square miles. Most of the western border is demarcated by the Colorado River. Most communities are on or near the Colorado River. All three Counties, and eight of the ten Cities and Towns have chosen to
        participate in and support the District formally.</p>

        <h3>Membership</h3>
        <p><strong>WAEDD</strong> is a membership-driven agency that is responsible for regional economic development strategy and planning. We collaborate with various public, private, and non-profit sector agencies to accomplish this goal. These
        entities work together to plan viable projects and provide services to the region.</p>
        <p>Economic development districts are designated in regions where the 24-month unemployment rate or the per capita income is less than 80 percent of the national average.</p>
        <p><i><strong>Thus, the District has the paradoxical mission of working itself out of a job by leveraging regional, state, and national partnerships to grow the number and diversity of employers who can create and grow quality jobs. We’re
        not there yet, but with your help, we can get there!</strong></i></p>
        <p>Contact the <a href="mailto:alan@waedd.org">Executive Director</a> for membership details.</p><a id="background"></a>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>As an EDA-designated EDD, <strong>WAEDD</strong> helps to lead the locally-based, regionally driven economic development planning process that leverages the involvement of the public, private and non-profit sectors to establish a
        strategic blueprint for regional collaboration.</p>
        <p>Economic Development Districts (EDDs) are multi-jurisdictional entities, commonly composed of multiple counties such as La Paz, Mohave, and Yuma in western Arizona.</p><a id="purpose"></a>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Our purpose is to drive rural prosperity through the responsible mobilization of human infrastructure, financial investment, physical assets, and natural capital to generate a healthy and collaborative local economy.</p><a id=
        "investment"></a>
        <h3>Investment</h3>
        <p>US Economic Development Administration (<strong>EDA</strong>) grants help to fulfill regional economic development strategies designed to accelerate innovation and entrepreneurship, advance regional competitiveness, create higher-skill,
        living-wage jobs, generate private investment, and fortify and grow industry clusters.</p><a id="funding"></a>
        <h3>Funding</h3>
        <p><strong>EDA</strong> regularly announces <a href="https://www.eda.gov/funding-opportunities/">Funding Opportunities</a> for all communities.</p>

        <h3>Strategy</h3>
        <p>We currently manage the recently published 2020-2023 CEDS for the three-county region.</p>
        <p>Our design strategy is to increase regional economic capacity, diversify local economies, promote fiber and other broadband networks, improve regional public works infrastructure, and guide the area's prosperity and resiliency.</p>
        <p>The strategic blueprint, known as a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (<strong>CEDS</strong>), is a strategy-driven plan for regional economic development.</p>
        <p>A <strong>CEDS</strong> is the result of a “regionally-owned” planning process designed to guide the economic prosperity and resiliency of an area or region.</p>
        <p>It provides a coordinating mechanism for individuals, organizations, local governments, and private industry to engage in a meaningful conversation and debate about the economic direction of their region.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.waedd.org/ceds-2020-08-22.pdf">Click here</a> to read the full CEDS document.</p><a id="distress"></a>
        <h3>Measuring Distress</h3>
        <p>To calculate whether our region may meet grant thresholds for unemployment and income, a Measuring Distress tool is used to quickly calculate economic distress.</p>
